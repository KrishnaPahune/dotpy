## Asychronous Programming
Asynchronous programming is a programming paradigm that allows tasks to execute independently of the main program flow, enabling non-blocking execution.
This means the program can continue running other operations while waiting for time-consuming tasks, such as network requests or file I/O, to complete.
Key Concepts:
Non-blocking Execution – The program does not pause while waiting for tasks to finish.

Concurrency – Multiple tasks can run in overlapping time periods, improving efficiency.

Event-driven Model – Often relies on events, callbacks, or promises to handle task completion.

Async/Await – A modern way to write asynchronous code in a synchronous-looking manner.
